what did you do yesterday? Are you stuck on something ? - DO Every Morning








java 8 pushed in eclipse, debug using 11 ; compalibility features.


// create a package com.lpu put this class in that and then compile.


1. Create class Student, Employee, Book, Calculator, Car.
this will have just the name and attributes and 1 or 2 methods you can think off.
 
2. Create a Java Project in Eclipse, name it may LpuJEE

3.Paste Triangle and Circle classes  in Eclipse and run them.


1. Add a Client Class to print Cricle.getArea() in its main, and make attribute variable of Circle class private.
2. 





class Employee{
double salary;
int id;
String empName;
String deptname;
Long phoneNo;
Address address;

}

class Address{
int hNo;
String streetName;
String city;
String state;
int pin;
String country;



}

class Department{
List empList;
String dpName;
Employee dHead;
Long code;
Address address;



}


Class Student{
String name;
int id;
Hostel hostel;

Student(){
name = "NA";
id = -1;
hostel =null;
}

Student(String name, int id, Hostel hostel){
this.name = name;
this.id = id;
this.hostel = hostel;
}

String getName(){

}

public static void main(String[] args){
Student st = new Student();
// create your own object here
Student st2 = new Student("Gyan",10,null);

//print the name of st2 here

}


}

Create Shape class and store 2 subclasses Circle1 and Cirecle2
store them in shape variabe and print getName 

WAP to reverse a String ?
char [] chArr = s.toCharArray();
print them backwards in Arrays ?
try out length(), substring, indexOf methods if String class.

Create interface Spinnable, and let shape also implement Spinnable.
let a method spin() be part of contract of Spinnable. i.e let Spinnable contain spin(), and in the method just print spinning.


what did you do yesterday? Are you stuck on something ? 
Practise overriding and overloading ?

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-strings-introduction/problem?isFullScreen=true

override equals and hashcode in circle class?
Create a git project in your eclipse using https://github.com/gyanendras/lpuJava.gits

Store 10 words in an Array and sort it in ascending using Arrays.sort()

18 Jan
Previous home work
Create 5 circle objects, put them in Array and sort them as per there radius.

19 Jan
Must - Create an Exception class BlackAndWhiteOnlyException which prints 
message that "Black and white specified" when color is set to "Black"

20 Jan - Create 5 Circle object and store them in a Arraylist and in a HashSet and print them from both.

23 Jan - Create a map of 5 Employees  and there Cars, and print keySet and Values using KeySet and Values method 
of HashMap. Hint Create Employee Class and Car Class and put them in a HashMap.
